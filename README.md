This repository is for the FA 2018 ADSA project to visualize educational disparity

Team members: Abhinav Das, Makiko Shimizu, JaeEun Lee, Caitlyn Guo, Candice Kang, Fan Huang, Sarah Zhou, Melissa Chen

Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/education-statistics#EdStatsCountry.csv">Education Statistics from the World Bank</a>

The purpose of this project is to visualize how various factors such as country, family income level, and regional socioeconomic status affect the educational attainment of students around the world.  

Our data allows us to be able to track the progress of a single country over time, or to analyze the status of various countries during a single year or period. 

Our current plan is to either use a correlation matrix, unsupervised learning, or boxplots to better understand our data. 

Our goal is to write a blog post or article, including graphs and visualizations, to highlight the discrepancy between education levels of students around the world.
